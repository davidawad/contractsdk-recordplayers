# ContractsSDK - Record Player Maintenance


If you're familiar with record players you probably know how difficult it is to make sure that they run in pristine condition, especially if it's a collectible.


This particular record player is called the CordaGraph

# Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

# Usage

## Running tests inside IntelliJ

We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the Gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils
plugin will make sure that some flags (like ``-javaagent`` - see below) are
set for you.

To switch to using the Gradle runner:

* Navigate to ``Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner`` (or search for `runner`)
  * Windows: this is in "Settings"
  * MacOS: this is in "Preferences"
* Set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
* Set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

If you would prefer to use the built in IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you can run ``gradlew installQuasar`` which will
copy your quasar JAR file to the lib directory. You will then need to specify ``-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar``
and set the run directory to the project root directory for each test.

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]
